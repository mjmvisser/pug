Dependencies
============

QML in Qt6 requires -accessibility, which requires at-spi2-core and at-spi2-core-devel.
Unfortunately, CentOS 6.2 does NOT provide these packages, as they require glib2 >= 2.26,
which CentOS 6.2 also does not provide.

This is the workaround I've come up with using packages from Fedora 14. Seems OK so far:

rpm -U rpm -U --nodeps ~mvisser/Downloads/glib2-2.26.0-2.fc14.x86_64.rpm ~mvisser/Downloads/glib2-devel-2.26.0-2.fc14.x86_64.rpm
rpm -ihv ~mvisser/Downloads/at-spi2-core-2.0.0-1.fc15.x86_64.rpm ~mvisser/Downloads/at-spi2-core-devel-2.0.0-1.fc15.x86_64.rpm

This isn't ideal, but it works (with runtime errors due to an incompatible zlib). I had a Qt5 build working with a modern glib2 
and at-spi2 built from tarball and installed in /usr/local, but a later install by the sysadmins of glib2 from yum seemed to break this.

At some point, we should build our own glib2-2.26 and at-spi2 rpms. Or wait for CentOS 7, which should have its own at-spi2.
